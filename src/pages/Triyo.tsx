              TRIYO is a data intelligence platform that gathers data on the

              client engagement, and process efficiencies. I had the opportunity

                When I first joined TRIYO, an issue that the marketing
                department was trying to overcome was that website visitors were
                not interacting with the content. From our Google Analytics, we
                can see that we had extremely high bounce rates, and visitors
                seldom visit other pages to learn more about the product. Why is
                that?

                For this case study, I will discuss the navigation redesign,
                pricing page redesign, and component design activities that I
                did as part of my internship. There were many other screens that
                were made, but were incomplete due to the timeline I had.

              We didn't have the resources to conduct user interviews formally,
              so in my free time I asked a couple of friends to go through the
              website for me. They would screen share the website, and were
              given general goals such as "Tell me what the product is." and
              "How does the product solve [use case]".

            <Typography variant="body2">
              <br />
              Through this unstructured interview, I found that all participants
              were confused with what exactly the product was, what it does, who
              this product is for, and why it was important even after combing
              all of the site pages. When asked further, some common themes
              emerged.

              To continue my research, I asked 3 of my friends to do a card
              sorting task on Google Sheets for me. I asked them tell me what
              they were thinking out loud, and to explain their choices when
              they can to me. The reasoning for their sorting was often related
              to how they usually find items on similar websites they are more
              familiar with.

              Using the research above, I created a new sitemap that would
              improve the intuitiveness of website navigation, increase the
              quality of information that users can look for, and reducing
              redundant pages across the site. It also serves as a visual
              blueprint for the website revamping plan. The revamped information
              architecture blueprint is still used in Triyoâ€™s current website.

              Triyo's product solves the use cases. Impactful interactive

              such as hover states, hit-box size, and usability heuristics were
              used to ensure the navigation bar was accessible to users. We

              our low-fidelity ideas did not make it to the final version due to
              technical limitations and we adjusted the designed accordingly.

              Through HotJar, we found that users weren't interacting with the

              found that because the slideshow control buttons that are on the
              side required too much effort to navigate, but also because of the
              lack of transparency on whether or not the information on the
              slides is relevant to them.

              Competitive analysis also found that other competitors tries to
              solve this issue by moving the slideshow controls to the center,
              or provide a menu for users to navigate with. We decided to do a
              mix of both to provide users with improved navigational
              convenience and transparency.

              I did a lot of learning in my time with TRIYO, one of the most
              helpful was being able to work beside product designers and

              component design, but most importantly I learned how to work and
